## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a **supervised regression model** that predicts the asking price of used cars from their attributes. Accurate price prediction has direct commercial value — it helps buyers avoid overpaying and helps sellers price competitively.

The project covers the **full machine learning pipeline**:

- ✅ Real-world data cleaning and string parsing
- ✅ Missing value imputation and duplicate removal
- ✅ Feature engineering and encoding
- ✅ Z-score standardization
- ✅ Training and comparison of three regression models
- ✅ Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** [Used Car Listings — Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/used-car-listings)
Scraped from an Indian online automobile marketplace.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Raw records | 9,582 rows |
| Raw features | 11 columns |
| Target variable | `AskPrice` (listed price in Indian Rupees) |
| Cleaned training set | 5,973 rows |
| Features after prep | 26 (after encoding & engineering) |

### Feature Overview

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `Brand` | Categorical | Car manufacturer (e.g., Maruti Suzuki, Toyota, BMW) |
| `model` | Categorical | Vehicle model — *dropped (high cardinality)* |
| `Year` | Numeric | Year manufactured — *dropped (collinear with Age)* |
| `Age` | Numeric | Age in years — key predictor |
| `kmDriven` | Numeric* | Total km driven (raw string, requires parsing) |
| `Transmission` | Categorical | Manual or Automatic |
| `Owner` | Categorical | First or second owner |
| `FuelType` | Categorical | Petrol, Diesel, or Hybrid/CNG |
| `PostedDate` | String | Listing month-year — *dropped (not a car attribute)* |
| `AskPrice` | Numeric* | **Target variable** — listed price in Rupees (raw string) |

> *`kmDriven` and `AskPrice` are raw strings in the source file and require parsing before use.*

## 🔧 Data Preparation

### Cleaning Steps

- **Parse raw strings** — Convert `kmDriven` (e.g., `'98,000 km'`) and `AskPrice` (e.g., `'Rs 1,95,000'`) from formatted strings to numeric floats
- **Handle missing values** — Impute 47 null values in `kmDriven` using the median calculated on training data only
- **Remove duplicates** — Drop 724 exact duplicate rows from the raw dataset
- **Feature engineering** — Drop `Year` (collinear with `Age`), `AdditionInfo`, `PostedDate` (low signal), and `model` (too many categories)
- **Brand filtering** — Retain only the top 16 brands by frequency; rare brands are removed to reduce noise
- **Encoding** — One-hot encode `Brand`, `Transmission`, `Owner`, and `FuelType` → integer 0/1 columns
- **Standardization** — Z-score scale `Age`, `kmDriven`, and `AskPrice` (mean=0, std=1) using a scaler fitted on training data only
- **Train/Test split** — Hold out 30% of data as an untouched test set before any cleaning or scaling

## 🧠 Models

Three regression models were trained and compared:

| Model | Strengths | Primary Metrics |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Linear Regression** | Interpretable baseline; coefficient ranking of features | R², MAE |
| **Random Forest** | Non-linear patterns; robust to outliers; feature importance | MAE, RMSE |
| **XGBoost** | Highest accuracy on tabular data; handles missing values | RMSE, R² |

All models are evaluated on the held-out test set using **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **R²**.
